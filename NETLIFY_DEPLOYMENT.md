# Netlify Deployment Guide for GIGM8

## 🚀 Quick Fix for Page Refresh Issues

The "Page Not Found" error when refreshing on Netlify is a common SPA (Single Page Application) issue. I've fixed this by adding the proper configuration files.

## 📁 Files Added/Modified

### 1. `public/_redirects`
```
/*    /index.html   200
```
This tells Netlify to serve `index.html` for all routes, allowing React Router to handle client-side routing.

### 2. `netlify.toml`
Complete Netlify configuration with:
- Build settings
- Redirect rules
- Security headers
- Caching rules

### 3. `public/404.html`
Fallback 404 page (copy of index.html) for additional safety.

### 4. `vite.config.ts`
Updated with proper build configuration for production.

## 🔧 Deployment Steps

1. **Commit and push all changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Netlify SPA routing issues"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Netlify will automatically deploy** from your GitHub repository.

3. **Verify the fix:**
   - Visit your live site
   - Navigate to any page (e.g., `/jobs`, `/resume-builder`)
   - Refresh the page - it should now work!

## 🛠️ Manual Netlify Configuration (if needed)

If automatic deployment doesn't work, manually configure in Netlify dashboard:

1. Go to **Site Settings** → **Build & Deploy** → **Build Settings**
2. Set:
   - **Build Command**: `npm run build`
   - **Publish Directory**: `dist`
   - **Node Version**: `18`

3. Go to **Site Settings** → **Build & Deploy** → **Redirects and Rewrites**
4. Add redirect rule:
   - **From**: `/*`
   - **To**: `/index.html`
   - **Status**: `200`

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### If pages still don't load after refresh:

1. **Check Netlify Functions** (if using):
   - Ensure functions are in `netlify/functions/` directory
   - Check function logs in Netlify dashboard

2. **Clear Netlify Cache**:
   - Go to **Deploys** tab
   - Click **Trigger Deploy** → **Clear cache and deploy site**

3. **Check Build Logs**:
   - Look for any build errors in the deploy logs
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed correctly

4. **Verify Environment Variables**:
   - Check that all required env vars are set in Netlify
   - Go to **Site Settings** → **Environment Variables**

## 📊 Performance Optimizations

The `netlify.toml` includes:
- **Caching headers** for static assets
- **Security headers** for better security
- **Gzip compression** (automatic)
- **CDN distribution** (automatic)

## 🚨 Important Notes

- The `_redirects` file must be in the `public/` directory
- The `netlify.toml` file must be in the root directory
- Make sure your build command produces files in the `dist/` directory
- All client-side routes should now work with page refreshes

## ✅ Testing Checklist

- [ ] Homepage loads correctly
- [ ] All navigation links work
- [ ] Page refreshes work on all routes
- [ ] 404 page works for invalid routes
- [ ] Build completes without errors
- [ ] All environment variables are set

Your SPA routing issues should now be completely resolved!
